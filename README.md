# understanding-typescript
A repo for Udemy's Understanding Typescript course. This course precedes Angular.

# What is Typescript?
It's a wrapper for JavaScript (compiles into JavaScript) that introduces new features to use in our code.
It does not run in the browser. We need to compile it into Javascript before. It's like an extra language to 
use during development.

It makes sure we are not introducing bugs because of wrong types.
